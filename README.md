# EL_kafka_chat

This is a quick hack for learning purposes.

I wanted to try out several parts in this project.
Mainly:
* Kafka
* Dear ImGui
* vcpkg

It was also a bit of a c++ warmup project.

## Known issues
First of all there are several bugs that I didn't wanted to spend time fixing,
but one caveat is that you can only connect to clients on the same computer.
Would be nice to be able to see it working more like a real chat.

## Requirements
* Docker
* OpenGL
* GLFW
* Dear ImGui

## Build



## Run
Start the Kafka backend
* docker compose up -d
